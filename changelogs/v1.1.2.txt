## [1.1.2] - 2026-01-28

### Added
* **CPU Presets system**:

  * Added configuration file `assets/cpu_presets.json` with support for popular Intel models (12th–14th gen) and AMD Ryzen (CCD architecture).
  * New automatic CPU architecture detection (P-cores, E-cores, Hyper-Threading, CCD).
  * Preset format documentation in `CPU_SCHEME_INSTRUCTION`.
* **Improved visualization in the Group Editor**:

  * Core grouping by clusters (e.g., Performance Cores, Efficient Cores, CCD 0, CCD 1).
  * Color indication for different thread types (P-cores, E-cores, HT threads).
  * Core labels display (e.g., P0, E8, C0).
* **Infrastructure**:

  * `cpu_presets.rs` module for parsing and matching presets.
  * `CpuSchema` model to represent a hierarchical CPU structure.
  * Support for test CPU models to debug the UI via `meta.rs`.

### Changed
* **Group Editor**:

  * Completely rewrote the core selection UI in `group_editor.rs` to support hierarchical schemas.
  * Improved core selection logic: now accounts for physical core and cluster membership.
* **State storage**:

  * `AppStateStorage` now automatically selects the best CPU schema on load.
  * Improved configuration save logic in `state.json`.
* **OS API**:

  * Added stubs and extensions for topology handling in `libs/os_api`.

### Fixed
* Fixed display of occupied cores when editing groups.
* Optimized rendering performance for large numbers of cores in the UI.
