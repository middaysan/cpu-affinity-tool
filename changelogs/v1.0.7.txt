This release focuses on improving system integration, enhancing code quality, and preparing the codebase for future Rust standards.

#### ✨ Features
- **System Tray Integration**: Added initial system tray support for Windows, providing better application lifecycle management and accessibility.
- **Enhanced UI Tooltips**: Running applications now show a hover tooltip containing their Process IDs (PIDs), making it easier to identify and manage specific instances.

- **Modern Rust Standards**: Applied safety annotations and updated code patterns to adhere to upcoming Rust 2024 standards.
- **Tray Interaction Logic**: Simplified tray commands and refined double-click behavior for a more intuitive user experience.
- **Localization**: All internal comments in core modules (`app.rs`, `tray.rs`) have been translated to English for better community collaboration.
- **Code Consistency**: Improved overall code readability and formatting across the project.

#### 🚀 Performance
- **Memory Allocation**: Integrated `mimalloc` as the default allocator to improve performance and memory efficiency.

#### 📦 Chore & Dependencies
- **Dependency Update**: Updated `windows` crate to version `0.62.2`.
- **Platform Support**: Added platform-specific dependencies to ensure smoother builds and runtime behavior.
