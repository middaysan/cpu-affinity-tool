### CPU Affinity Tool v1.1.5 - Changelog

#### Core & OS Integration
- **Process Priority Management**: Added support for setting the priority of the current process.
- **Improved Background Execution**: The application now automatically sets its own process priority to "Below Normal" to minimize interference with high-load applications.
- **Linux Enhancements**: Implemented process search by name and better process management for Linux systems.
- **Windows API Improvements**: Enhanced Windows process priority handling and process information retrieval.

#### CPU Presets & Detection
- **Regex-based Matching**: Migrated CPU detection logic to use regular expressions for more flexible and accurate hardware identification.
- **Multi-rule Support**: CPU presets now support multiple matching rules per configuration, allowing a single preset to cover more hardware variations.
- **New Hardware Support**: Updated and optimized `cpu_presets.json` with improved rules for modern Intel (including Core Ultra/Arrow Lake) and AMD (Ryzen) processors.
- **P-Core/E-Core Logic**: Refined handling of Performance and Efficient cores, including support for P-cores without Hyper-Threading (e.g., Arrow Lake).

#### App State & Stability
- **State Backup Rotation**: Improved data safety by implementing a rotating backup system for `state.json` (keeping `.old1` and `.old2` versions).
- **Application Monitoring**: Added `settings_matched` tracking to monitor whether running applications maintain their assigned CPU affinity and priority settings.
- **Repaint Optimization**: The UI now requests repaints more efficiently when background monitoring detects changes.

#### Testing & Technical
- **Expanded Test Suite**: Added comprehensive unit tests for CPU preset matching and state storage management.
- **Dependency Updates**: Updated `Cargo.lock` with necessary library improvements.
- **Code Quality**: Refined internal models for `AppState` and `RunningApp` for better maintainability and status tracking.
